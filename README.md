# Lasso-and-Tree-Based-Methods


#### LASSO and Boosting for Regression -- Communities and Crime data
  - Dealt with missing values
  
  - Fit a least squares model
  
  - Fit a ridge regression model with lambda chosen via CV
  
  - Fit a LASSO with lambda chosen via CV
  
  - Fit a PCR model with number of principal components chosen via CV
  
  - Fit a L1 penalized gradient boosting tree using XGBoost
  
#### Tree Based Methods -- APS failure data
  - Dealt with missing values
  
  - Trained a random forest to classify the data
    
    - Generated confusion matrix and ROC to evaluate model
    
  - Dealt with the class imbalance on the random forest model
  
  - Used WEKA integration with jupyter notebook to train a Logistic Model tree for classification
    
    - Implemented SMOTE to pre-process data to compensate for class imbalance
